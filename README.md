# Quick Introduction

This is part of machine learning model in Qualityum App. Qualityum is an application for classify quality and durability of fruits. We serve this to solve the IKM's problem in production management. We divide our work in machine learning into 2 part of model machine learning : model to quality classification and durability

# Deployed Link

Now, you are on durability model repository. You can found model for quality classification on : https://github.com/bangkit-capstone-0291/model-ml-quality-classification

For this durability we divide it again into 2 section : banana resistance and orange resistance


# A. Machine Learning Model For Durability (Banana)
1. We are using google colab and tensorflow 2.5.0 version to build the model.
2. Make sure to download/prepare dataset. Our source of dataset is from kaggle and we label it manually. We label it based on the colour, or texture. We got the information / reference from doing experiment in home to know how banana changes days by days and by looking other experiment using timelapse on youtube. Link for the youtube timelapse banana, only for reference : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERgCeui5bp4
3. But we already provide zip file in drive : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qHifJF6v6LBK3a-1vJKQNHskTQSsHgcx/view?usp=sharing
4. You can follow the step in each file (starts with collecting data, exploring dataset & preprocessing, build model from baseline and explore to get improvement in accuracy or maybe to solve overfitting).


# B. Machine Learning Model For Durability (Orange)
1. We are using google colab and tensorflow 2.5.0 version to build the model.
2. Make sure to download/prepare dataset. Our source of dataset is from kaggle and we label it manually. We label it based on the colour, or texture. We got the information / reference from doing experiment in home to know how banana changes days by days and by looking other experiment using timelapse on youtube.
