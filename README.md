# Quick Introduction
This is part of machine learning model in Qualityum App. Qualityum is an application for classify quality and durability of fruits. We divide it to 2 part of model machine learning : model to quality classification and durability

Now, you are on durability model repository. 
For this durability we divide it again into 2 section 
A. For banana resistance
B. For orange resistance

# A. Machine Learning Model For Durability (Banana)
# B. Machine Learning Model For Durability (Orange)
1. We are using google colab and tensorflow 2.5.0 version to build the model.
2. Make sure to download/prepare dataset. Our source of dataset is from kaggle and we label it manually. We label it based on the colour, or texture. We got the information / reference from doing experiment in home to know what days untill it rotten and by looking other experiment using timelapse on youtube. Link for the youtube timelapse orange only for reference : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPCPTUw3Oy4&t=29s 
3. But we already provide zip file in drive : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eDk3JkUpz5mqfvCkE1ZuZ8UFa-w8IfLG/view?usp=sharing
4. You can follow the step in each file (starts with collecting data, exploring dataset & preprocessing, build model from baseline and explore to get improvement in accuracy or maybe to solve overfitting).
